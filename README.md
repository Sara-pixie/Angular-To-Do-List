For canvas code I used [this repo](https://github.com/teropa/ng-gfx-demos/blob/master/src/app/animated-canvas-logo/animated-canvas-logo.component.ts) as a resource and changed the code to fit my needs, because I couln't find many examples of **how to animate and resize a full screen canvas** online <br/>
If you want to see how I did it look at [background.component.html](https://github.com/Sara-pixie/Angular-To-Do-List/blob/master/src/app/components/background/background.component.html) and [background.component.ts](https://github.com/Sara-pixie/Angular-To-Do-List/blob/master/src/app/components/background/background.component.ts)
